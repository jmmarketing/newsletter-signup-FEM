## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS (Responsive Mixins)
- Flexbox
- Mini-MVC
- Combo BEM + OOCSS Naming
- Vanilla JS
- SVG Media
- Some â˜•â˜•
- [Parcel Bundler](https://parceljs.org/)
- [gh-pages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gh-pages) - Deploying to GH Pages.

### What I learned

Nothing too crazy on this project. I wanted to see if I could use responsive images with srcset + sizes attribute. After playing with it for abou an hour, it just seems too clunky. Could see the value when your loading to sepcific user-agent or resolution, but responsive dragging was choppy at best.

### Continued development

Just keep working projects. I definitely probably over complicated this one in the MVC/SCSS approach. Could have easily been a single page CSS and JS file. Need to keep exploring projects that push knowledge/comfort boundaries a bit.
